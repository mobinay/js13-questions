Do you remember the game of hop?

Get a  number between 2 and 6 from the user(you can use prompt and alert in this practice), then log from 1 to 200 in the console.
It is just like the game of hop, whatever number the user enters, the numbers will be printed accordingly.

Example: If the user enters the number 3, the numbers will be printed like this:
1, 2, hop, 4, 5, hop, 7, 8, hop, 10 ..., 200 
*/
//! Answer:
const userInput = prompt("Enter a number between 2 and 6:");
const hopNumber = parseInt(userInput);

if (isNaN(hopNumber) || hopNumber < 2 || hopNumber > 6) {
  alert("Please enter a valid number between 2 and 6.");
} else {
  for (let i = 1; i <= 200; i++) {
    if (i % hopNumber === 0) {
      console.log("hop");
    } else {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
}
